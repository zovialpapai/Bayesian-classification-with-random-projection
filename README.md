Computer code to reproduce the numerical results presented in "Efficient Bayesian high-dimensional classification via random projection with application to gene expression data" (Chakraborty A., 2023+). Please reach out in abhisek_chakraborty@tamu.edu for any queries. Here, we present a short decription about the directories in the repository. (To be updated soon)

data: 
Micro-array gene expression cancer data sets utilized in the article is freely available on the website https://data.mendeley.com/. Copies of the data sets are available in the "data" directory in the our repository.

real data analysis: 
The directory contains the a R script named BCC_data.R that can be utilised to carry out the analysis of micro-array gene expression cancer data sets (Leukomia, Lung Cancer, Prostate cancer), presented in Section 4 of the paper.
